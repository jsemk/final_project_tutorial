# Creating a High Quality SVG Image
By: Jackson Semkin

This tutorial is designed specifically for students like myself who 
have never had experience creating digital media. In the tutorial, I will
explain how to open and properly save a file in Adobe Illustrator, how to
create basic shapes and add desired colors and will provide a link to the
discounted Adobe subscription that Mizzou students have access to.
For this tutorial, I will be relying heavily on what I have learned
in my intro to digital media design course. As a bonus, I will also
include my comical attempt at an SVG on Adobe Illustrator **BEFORE** I
knew how to navigate SVGs.
